# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is the **apk** project - a comprehensive application platform with advanced features for enterprise use. The project focuses on building a robust system with role-based access control, analytics, monitoring, and compliance features.

## Key Features & Components

Based on the project checklist, this application includes:

### Core Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - User permission and access management system
- **Enhanced Reporting and Analytics** - Data visualization and business intelligence
- **Barcode/QR Code Scanning** - Integration for inventory or asset management
- **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live system status and performance tracking
- **Audit Trails and Compliance** - Security logging and regulatory compliance
- **Customizable Notifications System** - Flexible alerting and communication

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep code modular and well-structured
- Follow separation of concerns principles
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Security Considerations
- Always validate user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Secure sensitive data with encryption
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails

### Testing Approach
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test security features thoroughly
- Validate compliance requirements
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

### Documentation Standards
- Document all public APIs
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Maintain up-to-date feature documentation
- Provide code comments for complex logic

## Architecture Patterns

- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Follow RESTful API design patterns
- Use proper data validation and sanitization
- Implement caching strategies for performance

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- Support containerized deployments
- Include proper monitoring and logging
- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Follow infrastructure as code principles

## Contributing Guidelines

When implementing new features:
1. Start with security considerations
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add appropriate logging and monitoring
4. Include relevant tests
5. Update documentation
6. Consider performance implications
7. Ensure compliance requirements are met
