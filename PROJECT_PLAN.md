# Advanced Inventory Management System - Updated Project Plan

## Project Overview
The Advanced Inventory Management System is a web-based application designed to manage inventory efficiently while providing robust audit capabilities, real-time notifications, and reporting functionality. The system supports role-based user authentication and allows administrators to monitor and control inventory with ease.

---

## Technology Stack
### Backend
- **Language**: PHP
- **Framework**: Laravel
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Templating Engine**: Blade (Laravel's templating system)

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and design.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsiveness and styling.
- **Optional Enhancements**: Integration of JavaScript libraries for dynamic interactivity.

### Deployment
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment on an Unraid server.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage Laravel, MySQL, and additional services like Redis if needed.

## Features
### Core Features
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Login/Logout functionality.
   - Role-based permissions (admin, manager, user).
   - Password hashing and security.
   - Login throttling to prevent brute force attacks.
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.
   - CAPTCHA verification on failed login attempts.
   - Email notifications for suspicious login activity.

2. **Inventory Management**:
   - CRUD operations for inventory items.
   - Fields: Name, SKU, Barcode, Category, Location, Expected Quantity, Actual Quantity.
   - Location Management:
     - Define and manage locations (e.g., warehouses, aisles, shelves).
     - Assign products to specific locations.
   - Barcode Scanning Integration:
     - Use mobile phone cameras or hardware barcode scanners.
   - Stock Adjustment Logs:
     - Log and track changes to inventory quantities.
   - Multi-Warehouse Support:
     - Track inventory across multiple warehouses.

3. **Stock Audit**:
   - Conduct stock audits to compare **actual quantities** with **expected quantities**.
   - Use barcode scanning (mobile or hardware) to quickly identify products.
   - Log discrepancies automatically.

4. **Exportable Reports**:
   - Generate PDF/CSV reports for inventory and audit logs.
   - Include summary statistics in reports.

## HTTPS Integration (Proposed Solution)
### Steps:
1. Integrate HTTPS into the deployment architecture using a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Apache.
2. Obtain and install an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., via Let's Encrypt or a commercial Certificate Authority).
3. Configure the web server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
4. Update any application settings or documentation to reflect HTTPS usage.
5. Test the application to ensure that all features (including WebSocket-based real-time updates) function correctly under HTTPS.

### Benefits:
- Encrypts all communication between client and server, protecting sensitive user and inventory data.
- Increases user trust and avoids browser security warnings.
- Meets security best practices and compliance requirements for handling user data.

### Notes:
- Additional configuration may be needed for Flask-SocketIO to work with HTTPS.
- Default credentials should also be replaced for production deployment.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Project Initialization
- Set up Laravel with MySQL.
- Configure `.env` for database connection.
- Install necessary Laravel libraries (e.g., Laravel Breeze for authentication).

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement User Authentication, Inventory Management, and Stock Audit.
- Add advanced search, filters, and bulk operations.

### Phase 3: Additional Features
- Add Real-Time Notifications and Exportable Reports.
- Implement Barcode Scanning Integration and Audit Session Logs.

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for deployment.
- Test the system on your Unraid server.
- Implement HTTPS integration as detailed above.
