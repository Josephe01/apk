### HTTPS Setup
- Integrate HTTPS using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
- Obtain and install an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., via Let's Encrypt or a commercial Certificate Authority).
- Configure the web server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Update application settings to support HTTPS URLs.
- Test the application to ensure all features work correctly under HTTPS, including WebSocket-based real-time updates.
- Update project documentation to reflect HTTPS usage.
