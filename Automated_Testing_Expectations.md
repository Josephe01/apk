# Automated Testing Expectations

This section details the standards and requirements for automated testing of the Inventory Management System.

---

## Testing Frameworks

- **PHPUnit** for unit and feature tests (Laravel default).
- **Pest** (optional) for expressive, readable tests.
- **Laravel Dusk** for browser/UI tests.
- **Mockery** for mocking dependencies.

---

## Test Coverage Requirements

- All critical business logic must be covered by unit or feature tests.
- Target at least **80% code coverage** for core modules (inventory, audits, user management).
- All controllers, models, and services must have at least basic coverage.

---

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

- Focus on individual methods/functions.
- No database or external dependencies.

### 2. Feature/Integration Tests

- Test full workflows (e.g., inventory adjustments, user roles).
- Should hit the database and/or external APIs if applicable.

### 3. UI/Browser Tests

- Use Laravel Dusk for critical user flows (login, add inventory, audit process).
- Cover mobile and desktop scenarios.

---

## Continuous Integration

- All tests must run automatically on every pull request using GitHub Actions or another CI provider.
- PRs must pass all tests before merging.
- Failures should block merges until resolved.

---

## Test Data & Isolation

- Use factories and seeders for test data.
- Database should be refreshed for every test run.
- Do not use production data in tests.

---

## Reporting & Quality Gates

- Test results must be visible in CI (GitHub Actions checks).
- Code coverage reports should be generated and reviewed.
- Optionally, use tools like Codecov or SonarCloud for reporting.

---

## Maintenance

- Keep tests up to date with code changes.
- Remove or update obsolete tests.
- Review flaky tests and stabilize or remove.
