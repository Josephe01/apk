# Frontend/UX Requirements

This section defines the standards and expectations for the user interface and user experience of the Inventory Management System.

---

## UI Library & Framework

- Use **Bootstrap 5** for all UI components (forms, buttons, tables, modals, etc.).
- Use **FontAwesome 6** for icons unless overridden by user preference.
- Blade templates must follow Laravel conventions for structure and inheritance.

---

## Layout & Navigation

- All main screens must use a responsive sidebar navigation, with quick access to Dashboard, Inventory, Audits, Reports, and Settings.
- Top navigation bar includes user profile dropdown, notifications, and theme switcher.
- Dashboard displays key metrics, recent activity, and notifications.

---

## Accessibility

- All forms and controls must be keyboard accessible.
- Use semantic HTML for forms, tables, and navigation.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.
- Include ARIA labels on interactive elements (buttons, modals, switches).
- Support screen readers for all major workflows.

---

## Forms & Validation

- Client-side validation: Use Bootstrap validation styles for instant feedback.
- Display all server-side validation errors at top of forms.
- Use placeholder text and helper labels for clarity.
- For critical actions (delete, bulk update), require confirmation dialogs.

---

## Interactivity

- Inventory and Audit pages use AJAX for dynamic updates (e.g., scan, adjust quantity).
- Use modals for create/edit forms and confirmations.
- Live notifications update in real time using broadcasting (Pusher or Laravel Echo).
- Filters, search, and pagination update without full page reload.

---

## Theming

- Support three themes: light, dark, blue.
- Theme selection is saved in user settings and applied globally.
- Allow switching icons between FontAwesome and Bootstrap sets.

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

- All views must be fully responsive for tablets and smartphones.
- Hamburger menu replaces sidebar on small screens.
- Tables collapse into cards on mobile.

---

## Error Handling & UX Feedback

- Show clear toast or modal notifications for success, error, and warnings.
- On failed API calls or server errors, show a friendly error message and retry option.
- Loading indicators for all asynchronous actions.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- New modules must follow the same layout, theming, and component standards.
- Custom fields should use Bootstrap form controls and validation.
