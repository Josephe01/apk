# Extensibility & Customization

This section describes how the Inventory Management System can be extended or customized to meet specific business requirements.

---

## Philosophy

- The system is designed to be modular and extensible.
- Custom features and integrations should be added without modifying core code whenever possible.

---

## Extending via Laravel

- Use Laravel Service Providers to register custom logic or integrations.
- Create new modules or packages as composer dependencies.
- Register event listeners for domain events (inventory changes, audits, etc.).
- Use Laravel’s middleware and policies for access control customization.

---

## Adding Features

- Add new models, controllers, and views in dedicated feature folders.
- Use Laravel’s artisan make: commands to scaffold components.
- Document all customizations and keep them separated from core code (use /custom or /modules).

---

## Integration Points

- Integrate with external APIs via dedicated service classes.
- Use Laravel’s jobs and queues for asynchronous tasks.
- Add notification channels (mail, SMS, Slack) using Laravel’s notification system.
- Support webhooks for external triggers.

---

## Configuration

- All custom settings should go into .env or dedicated config files in /config.
- Example: Add INVENTORY_CUSTOM_FIELDS to .env, reference in code via config('inventory.custom_fields').

---

## UI Customization

- Use Blade templates for front-end changes.
- Add custom components in /resources/views/components.
- Publish vendor assets for third-party package overrides.

---

## Updating & Maintenance

- Keep custom modules updated with core changes.
- Use composer and npm for dependency management.
- Document all customizations and update docs with every release.

---

## Best Practices

- Never modify core framework files.
- Keep custom code well-documented and separated.
- Use version control for all custom modules and config changes.
