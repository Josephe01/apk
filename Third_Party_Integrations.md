# Third-party Integrations

This section outlines all external services, APIs, and platforms the Inventory Management System must integrate with, including standards for security, reliability, and extensibility.

---

## Required Integrations

### 1. Authentication & Identity

- Integrate with OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.) for Single Sign-On (SSO).
- Support Laravel Socialite for provider abstraction.

### 2. Notifications

- Use **Pusher** or **Laravel Echo** for real-time notifications and broadcasting.
- Optional: Integrate with Slack or Microsoft Teams for audit alerts.

### 3. Barcode & QR Code

- Use third-party barcode/QR code library for scanning and generation (e.g., **Simple QrCode**, **Picqer/Barcode**).
- Support USB and mobile scanners via browser APIs.

### 4. Reporting & Export

- Integrate with **Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel** for XLS/CSV export.
- Optional: Connect to Google Sheets API for live reporting.

### 5. Cloud Storage

- Use **AWS S3**, **Azure Blob**, or **Google Cloud Storage** for file uploads and backups.
- Validate and sanitize all file uploads.

### 6. Email & Messaging

- Integrate with transactional email providers (e.g., **Mailgun**, **Sendgrid**) for notifications, password resets, and audit reports.
- Support SMS gateways for urgent alerts (Twilio, Nexmo).

### 7. API Access

- Provide a RESTful API using Laravel Sanctum or Passport for secure external access.
- Support API keys and OAuth2 for authentication.

---

## Security & Reliability

- All third-party connections must use HTTPS/TLS.
- Store credentials and API keys securely in `.env` and never commit secrets.
- Log all integration failures and retries.
- Allow for easy swapping or disabling services via config.

---

## Extensibility

- New integrations must be documented and follow service provider patterns.
- All integrations should be tested in staging before production use.
